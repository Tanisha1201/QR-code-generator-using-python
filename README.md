# QR-code-generator-using-python=
This project is a Python-based QR code generator that allows users to create scannable QR codes from URLs or any other text data. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use the qrcode library to create QR codes and how to work with images in Python. The generated QR codes are saved as images (PNG format) and can be displayed or downloaded.

QR codes are widely used in modern-day applications like linking to websites, making payments, and sharing contact information. This project provides a simple solution for generating QR codes programmatically.
